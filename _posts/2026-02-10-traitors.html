<p style="text-align:justify">Picture this: an evening on the sofa, wrapped in a warm blanket, ready to watch the new
    episodes of <em>The
        Traitors</em>. The round table arrives, tensions rise, and then you hear it: <em>“it’s not personal”</em>.
    If you opened this article, chances are you’re familiar with the show, which means you’ve heard this line more times
    than you can count (possibly second only to <em>“omg, they played a blinder”</em>).
    <span class="note">If not, you might want to pause here and binge all seasons before continuing.</span>
    Don’t get me wrong, I think, for the most part, that’s true. Especially early in the game, there’s very little
    genuine animosity. People aren’t voting out of spite or revenge, they simply have to put a name down and they don’t
    yet have much to go on. No one’s slipped up, no big mistakes, and yet, somehow, certain people are already
    <em>“giving traitor energy”</em>.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Still, “not personal” doesn’t necessarily mean neutral. When decisions are made on
    instinct, what feels like a
    harmless gut feeling can quietly follow familiar social patterns.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">A lot of viewers picked up on this feeling, and eventually <em>The Times</em> did too.
    They recently published a
    <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/uk/media/article/the-traitors-bias-race-gender-9m8t8mx2v">thoughtful piece</a>
    exploring whether players on <em>The Traitors</em> might be influenced by prejudice, particularly
    around race, gender, and age. I appreciated that they took these concerns seriously and that they looked at the
    data. Also, the article prompted further discussion elsewhere, which helped raise awareness and open up a broader
    debate.
</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Reading it pushed me to dig a little deeper myself. I wasn’t entirely convinced by some of
    the methodological choices
    made, and I kept wondering what the data might say if approached slightly differently.
    But before getting into the results, I want to explain the intuition behind my choices and lay out a few important
    premises.</p>

<hr>
<h4>Premises</h4>
<p style="text-align:justify">We need to keep in mind that <em>The Traitors</em> is, first and foremost, a <b>reality TV
        show</b>. As viewers at home, we
    see only a small, and heavily edited, slice of what actually happens. Context is missing, conversations are
    compressed, and some moments may even be “shaped” for narrative effect. This analysis is based solely on
    what is visible on screen. It is not, in any way, intended as a judgment of individual players or their personal
    behavior.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify"> <b>Public Tool:</b> To keep the process transparent and fun, I’ve made the data-analysis
    tool publicly available, so you can explore and play with the
    data yourself <a href="https://thetraitors.streamlit.app/">here</a>.</p>

<p style="text-align:justify">Gender and racial data were inferred using AI-based name analysis and may not reflect how
    contestants self-identify.
    Where possible, I cross-referenced these inferences with publicly available self-identification data, but
    inaccuracies are still possible. For the purposes of this analysis, the term People of Color is used to mean
    non-white, in line with the <a
        href="https://apastyle.apa.org/style-grammar-guidelines/bias-free-language/racial-ethnic-minorities">APA Style
        guidelines</a> on bias-free language. This was a personally challenging exercise, and I genuinely welcome
    corrections or suggestions to improve accuracy.
    Full datasets and code are also available on <a href="https://github.com/xoxor/theTraitors">GitHub</a>.</p>

<hr class="short">
<h4>Banishment vs Murder</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">The first thing that didn’t quite sit right with me was treating murders and banishments
    as the same kind of event.
    Murders are strategic decisions made by the Traitors behind closed doors. Banishments, especially early ones, are
    public, rushed, and based on very little information. Those first round tables are full of people openly admitting
    they’re “going with their gut”. If unconscious bias is going to show up anywhere, that feels like the most likely
    place. So I wanted to see if by focusing solely on banishments we would get different results.</p>

<h4>Civilians vs Celebrities</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">The second choice I wanted to revisit was the inclusion of the celebrity season.
    Celebrities don’t enter the game as
    blank slates. They come with public personas, reputations, and sometimes existing relationships. That almost
    certainly introduces different kinds of bias but not necessarily the ones being examined here. This is also why, for
    now, I’m focusing only on the UK version of the show, as it’s the only one with enough diversity and a cast made
    entirely of
    civilians.</p>

<h4>Votes vs Banishment</h4>

<p style="text-align:justify">Finally, as a huge fan of the show and someone with a PhD in preference aggregation, I
    couldn’t help but thinking at
    the votes casted rather than the outcome of the round table itself. Let me explain. In the most recent season, for
    example, Amanda intensely focused on Jade from the very beginning, with very little justification. Jade made it to
    the final, but she was under suspicion the entire time. To me, that persistent targeting matters, even if it doesn’t
    lead to banishment. Because banishment works on plurality, a small but concentrated block of votes can change
    outcomes without necessarily revealing the full picture of bias.</p>

<p>With all that in mind, let’s look at the data!</p>

<hr>

<h3>Early Banishments Analysis</h3>
<h5>Banishment vs Murder</h5>
<p>To test my intuition that banishments are fundamentally different from murders, I looked at banishments in the first
    four episodes (the same cutoff used by <em>The Times</em>) across all seasons, including the celebrity one.</p>

<p><b>Race:</b>Players of Color make up 28.8% of the starting cast, yet account for 46.7% of early banishments.</p>

<p> <b>Gender:</b> The starting cast is almost perfectly balanced by gender. Still, women make up 53.3% of early
    banishments. It’s not a
    massive difference on its own, but combined with the race data, it suggests that early perceptions of who seems
    “trustworthy” or “expendable” may be shaped by demographic factors rather than strategy alone.</p>

</figure>

<p>Interestingly, even when looking only at banishments, the overall patterns are very similar to those reported by
    <em>The Times</em>. Players of Color are still disproportionately represented among early exits, and women are still
    more likely to be eliminated early. In other words, while I still think banishments deserve separate attention,
    grouping murders and banishments together doesn’t dramatically change the headline result.
</p>

<h3>Who Survives the Longest?</h3>
<h5>Civilian vs Celebrity Seasons</h5>

<p>My second concern was the inclusion of the celebrity season. Because celebrity players arrive with established public
    images, and often preexisting relationship, these factors likely dampen some forms of unconscious bias examined
    here. <em>The Times</em> also acknowledged this, excluding the celebrity season from their finalist race analysis.
</p>

<p>Across civilian seasons:</p>
<ul>
    <li>White contestants consistently survive longer than Players of Color. White men have the longest average survival
        (nearly 8 episodes). Women of color have the shortest (just over 6 episodes).</li>
    <li>Men are more likely, on average, to reach the finale (56.7% vs. 43.3%).</li>
    <li>White contestants are disproportionately represented among finalists (81.7% compared to 18.3% Players of Color).
    </li>
</ul>

<figure>

        alt="Survival average and finalists by race and gender in civilian seasons.">
    <figcaption>
        Figure 2. Survival average and finalists by race and gender across all civilian seasons.

</figure>

<p>In the celebrity season:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Men still survive longer on average, but the gap is much narrower. Men of color have the longest average
        survival (around 7 episodes), while white women have the shortest (just over 5).</li>
    <li>The racial pattern flips entirely in the finale: 60% Players of Color versus 40% white contestants.</li>
</ul>

    <figcaption>
        Figure 3. Survival average and finalists by race and gender in the celebrity season.

</figure>

<p>This supports the hypothesis that the celebrity season does not follow the same bias patterns as civilian seasons.
</p>

<hr class="short">


<h3>Age Analysis</h3>

<p>Age offers another lens on how first impressions and group instincts play out. Older contestants are a smaller
    portion of the starting cast, less than 10% are over 60, and around 11% are aged 45–59, while contestants under 30
    make up the largest group at about 43%.</p>

<p>When we look at average survival contestants under 30 last just over 8 episodes on average. Those aged 30–44 survive
    around 7.7 episodes. Survival drops for older players: 45–59 year olds average 6 episodes, and those over 60 just
    over 5.</p>

    <figcaption>
        Figure 4. Survival age analysis across all seasons.

</figure>

<p>However, because of smaller sample sizes and potential game-mechanics confounds (e.g. performance in missions), I
    personally suggest to read this as suggestive rather than definitive evidence of age-based bias.</p>

<hr class="short">

<h3>Votes vs. Banishments</h3>

<p>My final question was whether voting tells a different story from banishments.</p>

<p>At the very first major round table, the gender split in the room is perfectly even: 50% men and 50% women. Despite
    this, voting behavior diverges sharply. A striking 76.8% of all votes are cast against women, with men receiving
    just 23.2%. That gap is far too large to be explained by representation alone and suggests that, in the earliest
    phase of the game, women are significantly more likely to be perceived as suspicious or expendable. This pattern
    holds across all seasons except the third, where the gap is smaller.</p>

<p>By contrast, the racial composition at this stage is 73.2% white and 26.8% Players of Color, and voting by race
    mirrors this baseline: white players receive 69.5% of votes, and Players of Color 30.5%. The racial gap exists, but
    it’s smaller than the gap in banishments. Because the banishments are decided by plurality, even a relatively small
    number of concentrated votes can still have a big impact.</p>

<figure>
    <img src="/img/posts/traitors/votes.png"
        alt="Votes received at the first round table by race and gender for all civilian seasons.">
    <figcaption>
        Figure 5. Votes received at the first round table by race and gender for all civilian seasons.
    </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Interestingly, looking at round tables two and three (extending the analysis to episode four), the gender gap in
    voting narrows, while racial disparities in targeting tend to widen. This suggests a shift in how suspicion is
    socially distributed as the game progresses.</p>

<hr>
<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>So, is it “not personal”? In the narrow sense the players mean it, probably yes. Most early decisions on aren’t
    driven by malice, vendettas, or conscious prejudice. They’re made under pressure, with
    little information, and a strong sense that someone has to go.</p>

<p>But the data suggests that “not personal” doesn’t mean “random”.</p>

<p>Across civilian seasons, early banishments and voting patterns consistently fall harder on certain groups (mainly women and Players of Color) well before
    there is meaningful strategic information to justify those choices. When people rely on gut feelings, those
    instincts appear to draw on familiar social shortcuts about who seems suspicious, trustworthy, or expendable.</p>

<p>Examining votes rather than just outcomes reinforces this: even when someone isn’t banished, persistent targeting
    reveals who is being framed as suspicious from the very start.</p>

<p>The contrast with the celebrity season strengthens this interpretation. When players enter the game with established
    public identities and reputations, many of these patterns weaken or even reverse. That suggests the biases observed
    in civilian seasons aren’t inevitable features of the game itself, but products of first impressions.</p>

<p>None of this means individual players are doing something wrong, nor does it imply deliberate bias. What it does show
    is how quickly social perceptions can crystallize when information is scarce and how those perceptions can quietly
    shape collective decisions.</p>

<p>In other words, <em>The Traitors</em> may not be personal but it is human, and when humans vote on instinct, the data
    suggests those instincts are rarely neutral.</p>
